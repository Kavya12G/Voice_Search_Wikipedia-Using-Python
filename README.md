Voice-Search-Wikipedia
=======================
Hii all, I developed this project named **VOICE-SEARCH-WIKIPEDIA** using python. This application allowed users to search Wikipedia using voice commands, enhancing accessibility and user experience. 
Leveraged Python libraries such as SpeechRecognition for voice input, Pyttsx3 for text-to-speech conversion, and the Wikipedia API for fetching and displaying search results.


**Before, getting into the actual code, we need to understand, that this chatbot or assistant will be voice-based, so we need to import the following modules.**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**pyttsx3:** A python package that supports common text to speech engines on Mac OS, Windows and Linux.

**speech_recognition:** Library for performing speech recognition, with support for several engines and APIs, like CMU Sphinx, Microsoft Bing Voice Recognition, Google Cloud Speech API etc.

**wolframalpha:** Python’s support library for WolframAlpha computational intelligence .

**wikipedia:** Python’s library that makes it easy to access and parse data from Wikipedia.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**To install the above modules on your system, use the following :**

pip install pyttsx3, 
pip install SpeechRecognition,
pip install wolframalpha,
pip install wikipedia,

**Creating a WolframAlpha Account**
Since, this chatbot uses WolframAlpha API to find answers, the user must create a free account by signing up at . Follow the steps required to set up a student account that is free and is for personal use only. Generate your app-id and copy it for further reference.

**Concepts Followed**
**Speech Recognition:** Speech recognition is the ability of a machine or program to identify words and phrases in spoken language and convert them to a machine-readable format.
**TTS – text to speech**: a form of speech synthesis that converts text into spoken voice output.
